# Computer-Based-Optimization-Techniques

## IMPORTANT!!!

### Code of conduct

+ We are supposed to implement revised simplex method in any language of our choice. Since python library `numpy` has all the availble inverse, matrix-multiplication in-built functions, we are going to code in `Python`.

+ If you want to modify the code, create an issue and the others will review your approach and then we may carry on with implementing.

+ Try to create functions for tasks as it would be easier to understand and debug.

+ Do not create different files or upload any irrelavant files. You are however free to share some links related to algorithm and code implementation. 

I request all the collaborators to be active and respond well to the work. Let us complete the work in 3 days.

*If you have any doubts or issues while running the code, create a new issue.*
